In this project, we explore how chronic stress influences circadian rhythms in the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for motivated behavior. Loss of motivation is a central feature of major depressive disorder, and depression has been linked to circadian clock dysfunction in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. We propose that disruption of the circadian clock due to chronic stress attenuates the rhythmic release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, driving the emergence of depressive phenotypes.

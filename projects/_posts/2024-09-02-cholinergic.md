In this project, we (in collaboration with Dr. Jun Wang, TAMHSC) test the hypothesis that a cholinergic feedback loop from the SCN, to the basal forebrain, and back is necessary to reinforce circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. We propose that rhythmic SCN input to the basal forebrain weakens with age and in diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s, inhibiting cholinergic feedback to the SCN, which weakens the SCN signal even more. This leads to a breakdown of the feedback loop and, consequently, health impairment.

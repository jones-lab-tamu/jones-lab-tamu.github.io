We are broadly interested in understanding circadian output circuitry. Other questions we are focusing on include (but are not limited to): defining the "transfer function" that takes place in SCN target neurons and determining the role of local clocks in this encoding process, identifying how rhythms in the brain reflect hormone differences in circadian outputs and how brain clocks are regulated by hormone release, and determining how the circadian system integrates SCN input and noise and if particular input neurons are more robust to noise than others.

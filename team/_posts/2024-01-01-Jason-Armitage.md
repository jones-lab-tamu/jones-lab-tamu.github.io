Jason graduated in 2022 from the University of North Texas with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems. In the Jones Lab he is primarily focused on embedded systems engineering where he designs, constructs, and programs devices to automate and enhance testing and data collection for a variety of experiments. Jason began programming in 2011, primarily focusing on C++ and Python. Over the years he has also become proficient in CAD 3D modeling, as well as both high and low voltage electrical engineering. Jason has built solid state tesla coils, the worlds lightest computer mouse, “nuclear” dice set, and more. It was through these sorts of projects where he self taught and became proficient in an array of skills. In his free time Jason enjoys producing youtube videos, travelling, and spending time outdoors hiking, camping, and fishing.

Jeff obtained his Ph.D. in 2015 in the lab of [Dr. Douglas McMahon at Vanderbilt University][1] where his research focused on the bidirectional relationship between the molecular and electrical rhythms in the brainâ€™s biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). After a brief postdoc with [Dr. Luis de Lecea at Stanford University][2] to learn in vivo imaging, Jeff joined the lab of [Dr. Erik Herzog at Washington University in St. Louis][3] in 2016, where he studied the inputs to and outputs from the SCN that together generate circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. In 2021, Jeff started his lab in the Department of Biology at Texas A&M.

Arthur is in his third year of undergraduate studies, focusing on molecular and cellular neuroscience. Previously he worked in the Maren Lab, studying how locus coeruleus modulation affects fear memory acquisition. During the summer of 2024 he was selected to participate in the Salk Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship. At Salk, Arthur worked in the Talmo Lab, researching how AI can be utilized in the early diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. He learned how to build home cage monitoring systems, use pose estimation software to create behavioral models, and analyze data. After the summer, Arthur moved to the Jones Lab where he continues to use and develop systems for long-term behavior tracking. Currently he is working on combining miniscope brain recordings with CBASv2 in order to correlate SCN activity with behavior. After completing his undergraduate studies, Arthur plans to pursue a Ph.D., wanting to focus on how new AI behavior tracking tools can be utilized in the neuroscience field.

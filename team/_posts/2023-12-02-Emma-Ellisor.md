Emma is in her fourth year of undergraduate studies with a concentration in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. She works alongside Vanessa and assists in the investigation of how the suprachiasmatic nucleus behaves independently of the brain in standard nocturnal mice and diurnal Rhabdomys mice. Along with her work within the Jones lab, Emma also assists in the Moscarello lab, investigating novel fear memory extinction methods and the succeeding c-Fos expression within the dorsal hippocampus. Emma plans to pursue a Ph.D and hopes to have a lab of her own one day that examines the intersection between the neurobiology of sleep and memory systems.

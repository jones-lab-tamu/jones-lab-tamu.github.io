# Abstract 

To examine the interaction between molecular, electrical and behavioral circadian rhythms, we combined optogenetic manipulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) firing rate with bioluminescence imaging and locomotor activity monitoring. Manipulating firing rate reset circadian rhythms both ex vivo and in vivo, and this resetting required spikes and network communication. This suggests that SCN firing rate is fundamental to circadian pacemaking as both an input to and output of the molecular clockworks.
